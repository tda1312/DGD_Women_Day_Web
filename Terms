                        <p><b>International Women's Day</b> (March 8) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. The 
                            day also marks a call to action for accelerating women's equality.</p>
                        <p>IWD has occurred for well over a century, with the first IWD gathering in 1911 supported by over a million people. 
                            Today, IWD belongs to all groups collectively everywhere. IWD is not country, group or organization specific.</p>
